Compare files using diff commands
touch commands to create files on command line
installing the text editor and creating first text file


How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You can see what has been changed and if the changes are related to the bug.  Diff command
helped to identify both easily rather than going thru changes manually.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a
more efficient programmer in the long term?
You dont have to worry about to manage different historical versions of the file
Increased Focus - focus on problem in hand
Version Control - can help you to dig out old code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
==> cons is that you may wait bit too long to commit the changes, which can be too big
causing merge issue, or loosing work before commit
==> pros - programmer can club changes together to make a logical unit, such that
its traceable in future through commit history and comments associated
Vs Automatically saved - no associated comments and every save creating version
its like too much version history and hard to compare


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
==> both systems are used for different purposes, one where inter-dependency between
files commit set and other individual files are required versions.s

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists all the files in the current repository with commit details like id and comments
git diff command show what are the differences between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
as there is fallback option to revert, check the history of changes, there is
nothing to loose if we break something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
further advanced git commands/actions on command prompt
