#this is lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When this is a shared repository, multiple developers are working on same piece of code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want to pull only relevant changes, which are required locally.
Not all changes happens on remote can be applied to local copy, since there could be changes on local files.
